# UAlbany-Discord

Welcome to the Discord Server for UAlbany Affiliates!

**Guidelines:**

UAlbany students, alumni, applicants, faculty, or anyone associated with UAlbany in any way are welcome here. To clear things, you don't necessary have to be a student at UAlbany to be a part of the server. This is just a community served for people to communicate with others and have open conversations.

We do not limit this server to one's age, ethnicity, nationality, religion, culture, sexual orientation, political views. Please be mindful when using #general to chat with other users. We will not tolerate any forms of racism, discrimination or hate-speech.

**Rules:**

Standard chat etiquette should always be applied when having discussions or open-ended conversations with others. With that being said, it's safe to say that everyone here should know better and we do not need to mention every particular detail on how one should behave on a public server.

1 - Do not solicit anyone for course work publicly upon any channel on the server. You are free to ask for help on #request-help and someone may be able to answer, but don't engage in the act of "begging" or "bribing" someone to send you their answers. Although we are not responsible for acts of plagiarism and cannot hold you accountable for it, keep in mind you are committing academic dishonesty, which can hurt you deeply if caught.

2 - No "doxxing" or sharing personal information of anyone without their consent. You are free to talk about professors and faculty at UAlbany since everything you need to know about them is public already.

If you have any questions or concerns about the server, you can directly message anyone with the "Administrator" role.

If you have any questions or concerns about UAlbany, you can ask in #general or send a direct message to anyone with the "Resident Assistant" or "Housing Manager" role.
